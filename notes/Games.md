Source is a 3D video game engine developed by Valve Corporation as the successor of GoldSrc. It debuted with Counter-Strike: Source in June 2004, followed shortly by Half-Life 2, and has been in active development since. Source does not have a concise version numbering scheme; instead, it is designed in constant incremental updates.[1] The successor, Source 2, was officially announced in March 2015, with the first game to use it being Dota 2, which was ported over from Source later that year.

The Source SDK tools are criticised for being outdated and difficult to use.
