I want diagnostics to be present on all products.

The appliance currently has an issue where the diagnostics token from the
API server is not returned.

 * This could be addressed by the API server handing unknown appliances specially
   and putting them all in a broken reseller account ID.
 * This could also be handled by not using the token server any more for diag tokens.

TODO
----

 * add script generation for PowerShell
 * Fix blank node references
 * Generate windows install nsis
