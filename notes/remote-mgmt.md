At the arch council meeting of 4/13/2015 we discussed remote management and what
common approaches can be taken between groups.

 * Identify requirements of each team.
 * Is pubsub the correct approach
   * What are all of the approaches
 * *Settings* for each product
 * I suggested this describes RDF
   * Reification - statements about statements
 * Remote display of dashboard (like appliance)
   * keep appliance UI or use portal UI ?
 * Ability of MSPs etc to manage more than one appliance (or product?) at once
 * Ability to see multiple appliances (or other products) in a summary mode
   * This is more for status monitoring
 * What about monitoring - instead of just remote management
 * What about remote deploy
   * Can we leverage ideas from Omaha (google)
   * Perhaps this is easier - like how the browsers do this ("green" updates?)
 * Not platform or cloud provider specific
 * AMQP or XMPP ?
   * Need to weigh pros and cons
 * Need to talk to Chris.P about what he thinks the issues are
