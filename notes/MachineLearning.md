Text Mining/Analytics
---------------------

http://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/top-free-software-for-text-analysis-text-mining-text-analytics/

### Pattern

http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern

Pattern is a web mining module for the Python programming language.

It has tools for data mining (Google, Twitter and Wikipedia API, a web crawler, a HTML DOM parser), natural language processing (part-of-speech taggers, n-gram search, sentiment analysis, WordNet), machine learning (vector space model, clustering, SVM), network analysis and <canvas> visualization.

### Mahout

https://mahout.apache.org/

The Apache Mahout project's goal is to build an environment for
quickly creating scalable performant machine learning applications.

Apache Mahout software provides three major features:

 * A simple and extensible programming environment and framework
   for building scalable algorithms
 * A wide variety of premade algorithms for Scala + Apache Spark,
   H2O, Apache Flink
 * Samsara, a vector math experimentation environment with R-like
   syntax which works at scale

### LPU

https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/LPU/LPU-download.html

LPU (which stands for Learning from Positive and Unlabeled data) is a text learning or classification system that learns from a set of positive documents and a set of unlabeled documents (without labeled negative documents). This type of learning is different from classic text learning/classification, in which both positive and negative training documents are required.

### OpenNLP

https://opennlp.apache.org/

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for
the processing of natural language text.

It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence
segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction,
chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are
usually required to build more advanced text processing services.
OpenNLP also includes maximum entropy and perceptron based machine
learning.

### UIMA

http://uima.apache.org/

Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems
that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to
discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user. An example UIM
application might ingest plain text and identify entities, such as
persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as works-for or
located-at.

UIMA enables applications to be decomposed into components, for
example "language identification" => "language specific segmentation"
=> "sentence boundary detection" => "entity detection (person/place
names etc.)". Each component implements interfaces defined by the
framework and provides self-describing metadata via XML descriptor
files. The framework manages these components and the data flow
between them. Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between
these languages.

### tm - Text Mining Package for R

http://tm.r-forge.r-project.org/

The tm package offers functionality for managing text documents,
abstracts the process of document manipulation and eases the usage
of heterogeneous text formats in R. The package has integrated
database back-end support to minimize memory demands. An advanced
meta data management is implemented for collections of text documents
to alleviate the usage of large and with meta data enriched document
sets.

The package provides native support for reading in several classic
file formats (e.g. plain text, PDFs, or XML files). There is also
a plug-in mechanism to handle additional file formats.

### KH Coder

http://khc.sourceforge.net/en/

KH Coder is a free software for quantitative content analysis or
text mining. It is also utilized for computational linguistics. You
can analyze Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese
and Spanish text with KH Coder. Also, Chinese (simplified, UTF-8),
Korean and Russian (UTF-8) language data can be analyzed with the
latest Alpha (Ver. 3).

### Carrot2

http://project.carrot2.org/index.html

Carrot2 is an Open Source Search Results Clustering Engine. It can automatically organize small collections of documents (search results but not only) into thematic categories.

### TAMS Analyzer for Macintosh OS X

http://tamsys.sourceforge.net/

TAMS stands for Text Analysis Markup System. It is a convention for
identifying themes in texts (web pages, interviews, field notes).
It was designed for use in ethnographic and discourse research.

TAMS Analyzer is a program that works with TAMS to let you assign
ethnographic codes to passages of a text just by selecting the
relevant text and double clicking the name of the code on a list.
It then allows you to extract, analyze, and save coded information.
TAMS Analyzer is open source; it is released under GPL v2. The
Macintosh version of the program also includes full support for
transcription (back space, insert time code, jump to time code,
etc.) when working with data on sound files.

### GATE

General Architecture for Text Engineering

https://gate.ac.uk/

GATE is...

 * open source software capable of solving almost any
   text processing problem
 * a mature and extensive community of developers, users,
   educators, students and scientists
 * a defined and repeatable process for creating robust and
   maintainable text processing workflows
 * in active use for all sorts of language processing tasks
   and applications, including: voice of the customer; cancer
   research; drug research; decision support; recruitment; web
   mining; information extraction; semantic annotation
 * the result of a €multi-million R&D programme running since
   1995, funded by commercial users, the EC, BBSRC, EPSRC, AHRC,
   JISC, etc.
 * used by corporations, SMEs, research labs and Universities
   worldwide
 * the Eclipse of Natural Language Engineering, the Lucene
   of Information Extraction, the ISO 9001 of Text Mining
 * a world-class team of language processing developers
