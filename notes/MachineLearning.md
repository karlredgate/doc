---------------------

http://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/top-free-software-for-text-analysis-text-mining-text-analytics/

### Pattern

http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern

Pattern is a web mining module for the Python programming language.

It has tools for data mining (Google, Twitter and Wikipedia API, a web crawler, a HTML DOM parser), natural language processing (part-of-speech taggers, n-gram search, sentiment analysis, WordNet), machine learning (vector space model, clustering, SVM), network analysis and <canvas> visualization.

### Mahout

https://mahout.apache.org/

The Apache Mahout project's goal is to build an environment for
quickly creating scalable performant machine learning applications.

Apache Mahout software provides three major features:

 * A simple and extensible programming environment and framework
   for building scalable algorithms
 * A wide variety of premade algorithms for Scala + Apache Spark,
   H2O, Apache Flink
 * Samsara, a vector math experimentation environment with R-like
   syntax which works at scale

### LPU

https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/LPU/LPU-download.html

LPU (which stands for Learning from Positive and Unlabeled data) is a text learning or classification system that learns from a set of positive documents and a set of unlabeled documents (without labeled negative documents). This type of learning is different from classic text learning/classification, in which both positive and negative training documents are required.

### OpenNLP

https://opennlp.apache.org/

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for
the processing of natural language text.

It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence
segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction,
chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are
usually required to build more advanced text processing services.
OpenNLP also includes maximum entropy and perceptron based machine
learning.

### UIMA

http://uima.apache.org/

Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems
that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to
discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user. An example UIM
application might ingest plain text and identify entities, such as
persons, places, organizations; or relations, such as works-for or
located-at.

UIMA enables applications to be decomposed into components, for
example "language identification" => "language specific segmentation"
=> "sentence boundary detection" => "entity detection (person/place
names etc.)". Each component implements interfaces defined by the
framework and provides self-describing metadata via XML descriptor
files. The framework manages these components and the data flow
between them. Components are written in Java or C++; the data that
flows between components is designed for efficient mapping between
these languages.

### tm - Text Mining Package for R

http://tm.r-forge.r-project.org/

The tm package offers functionality for managing text documents,
abstracts the process of document manipulation and eases the usage
of heterogeneous text formats in R. The package has integrated
database back-end support to minimize memory demands. An advanced
meta data management is implemented for collections of text documents
to alleviate the usage of large and with meta data enriched document
sets.

The package provides native support for reading in several classic
file formats (e.g. plain text, PDFs, or XML files). There is also
a plug-in mechanism to handle additional file formats.

### KH Coder

http://khc.sourceforge.net/en/

KH Coder is a free software for quantitative content analysis or
text mining. It is also utilized for computational linguistics. You
can analyze Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese
and Spanish text with KH Coder. Also, Chinese (simplified, UTF-8),
Korean and Russian (UTF-8) language data can be analyzed with the
latest Alpha (Ver. 3).

### Carrot2

http://project.carrot2.org/index.html

Carrot2 is an Open Source Search Results Clustering Engine. It can automatically organize small collections of documents (search results but not only) into thematic categories.

### TAMS Analyzer for Macintosh OS X

http://tamsys.sourceforge.net/

TAMS stands for Text Analysis Markup System. It is a convention for
identifying themes in texts (web pages, interviews, field notes).
It was designed for use in ethnographic and discourse research.

TAMS Analyzer is a program that works with TAMS to let you assign
ethnographic codes to passages of a text just by selecting the
relevant text and double clicking the name of the code on a list.
It then allows you to extract, analyze, and save coded information.
TAMS Analyzer is open source; it is released under GPL v2. The
Macintosh version of the program also includes full support for
transcription (back space, insert time code, jump to time code,
etc.) when working with data on sound files.

https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-Vicariouss-Recursive-Cortical-Network-and-Numentas-Cortical-Learning-Algorithm

### Vicarious

Does something called a "Recursive Cortical Network".

Vicarious is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain. Known as the Recursive Cortical Network (RCN), it is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans. The system is powered by a balanced approach that takes sensory data, mathematics, and biological plausibility into consideration.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_(company)
http://www.kurzweilai.net/vicarious-announces-15-million-funding-for-ai-software-based-on-the-brain

RCN is an extension of the motivation behind hierarchical temporal memory (HTM), a machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins and Dileep George of Numenta, Inc. â€” to model some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_temporal_memory

### OpenNN (OSS)

OpenNN is an open source class library written in C++ programming
language which implements neural networks, a main area of deep
learning research. It is intended for advanced users, with high C++
and machine learning skills.

The library implements any number of layers of non-linear processing
units for supervised learning. This deep architecture allows the
design of neural networks with universal approximation properties.

The main advantage of OpenNN is its high performance. This library
outstands in terms of execution speed and memory allocation. It is
constantly optimized and parallelized in order to maximize its
efficiency.

### a(rtificial)Human (OSS?)

aHuman Project started in 2008 to create alive being by means of a
computer.  After a while it became clear that project belongs to
Artificial Life area and to some extent it is attempt to be a God.

http://wiki.ahuman.org/index.php/Main_Page

### Blue Brain Project

The goal of the Blue Brain Project is to build biologically detailed
digital reconstructions and simulations of the rodent, and ultimately
the human brain. The supercomputer-based reconstructions and
simulations built by the project offer a radically new approach for
understanding the multilevel structure and function of the brain.
The project's novel research strategy exploits interdependencies
in the experimental data to obtain dense maps of the brain, without
measuring every detail of its multiple levels of organization
(molecules, cells, micro-circuits, brain regions, the whole brain).
This strategy allows the project to build digital reconstructions
(computer models) of the brain at an unprecedented level of biological
detail.  Supercomputer-based simulation of their behavior turns
understanding the brain into a tractable problem, providing a new
tool to study the complex interactions within different levels of
brain organization and to investigate the cross-level links leading
from genes to cognition.

### Numenta - NuPIC (OSS)

NuPIC is an open source project based on a theory of neocortex
called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). Parts of HTM theory have
been implemented, tested, and used in applications, and other parts
of HTM theory are still being developed. Today the HTM code in NuPIC
can be used to analyze streaming data. It learns the time-based
patterns in data, predicts future values, and detects anomalies.
NuPIC includes discussion groups on HTM theory, research on extending
HTM, and source code for complete applications based on HTM. We
welcome participation in all of these areas.

http://numenta.org/

HTM is related to the RCN that Vicarious is doing.  I do not know how
specifically - yet.

### Encog (OSS)

Encog is an advanced machine learning framework that supports a
variety of advanced algorithms, as well as support classes to
normalize and process data. Machine learning algorithms such as
Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Bayesian
Networks, Hidden Markov Models, Genetic Programming and Genetic
Algorithms are supported. Most Encog training algoritms are
multi-threaded and scale well to multicore hardware. Encog can also
make use of a GPU to further speed processing time. A GUI based
workbench is also provided to help model and train machine learning
algorithms. Encog has been in active development since 2008.

common neural network architectures. It contains well designed,
open source Java library with small number of basic classes which
correspond to basic NN concepts. Also has nice GUI neural network
editor to quickly create Java neural network components. It has
been released as open source under the Apache 2.0 license, and it's
FREE for you to use it.

http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/

### Neural Network Designer

This project consists out of a windows based designer application
and a library (that can run on multiple platforms, including android)
together with several demo applications (including an MVC3 chatbot
client and an android application).

It is probably best compared to a database management system, but
for neural networks instead of relational data. As such, the library
is optimized for handling any type of data-size by using advanced
streaming and caching algorithms.

With the designer, you are able to create different types of decision
trees, random forests, n-grams, pattern-matchers, conversational
agents and all sorts of AI related algorithms. You can combine
statistical approaches as well as pattern matchers or others. Do
natural language processing, image or data analysis & interpretation,...

https://sourceforge.net/projects/nnd/

### SNIPE (OSS?)

SNIPE is a well-documented JAVA library that implements a framework
for neural networks in a speedy, feature-rich and usable way. It
is available at no cost for non-commercial purposes; if you plan
to use it in a commercial way, please get in touch with me.

SNIPE was originally designed for high performance simulations with
lots and lots of neural networks (even large ones) being trained
simultaneously. Recently, I decided to give it away as a professional
reference implementation that covers the network aspects handled
with in my manuscript "A Brief Introduction to Neural Networks",
while at the same time being faster and more efficient than lots
of other implementations due to the original high-performance
simulation design goal.

http://www.dkriesel.com/en/tech/snipe

### Torch Toolkit

The goal of Torch is to have maximum flexibility and speed in
building your scientific algorithms while making the process extremely
simple. Torch comes with a large ecosystem of community-driven
packages in machine learning, computer vision, signal processing,
parallel processing, image, video, audio and networking among others,
and builds on top of the Lua community.

At the heart of Torch are the popular neural network and optimization
libraries which are simple to use, while having maximum flexibility
in implementing complex neural network topologies. You can build
arbitrary graphs of neural networks, and parallelize them over CPUs
and GPUs in an efficient manner.

### Convultions

I don't think this is open source software - but an architecture.

We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed
Inception that achieves the new state of the art for classification
and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge
2014 (ILSVRC2014). The main hallmark of this architecture is the
improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network.
By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of
the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To
optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the
Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One
particular incarnation of this architecture, GoogLeNet, a 22 layers
deep network, was used to assess its quality in the context of
object detection and classification.
