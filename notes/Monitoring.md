Activity on the Internet never stops, but Panopta is always watching.
We’ve created the Performance Index to help you see how the top
Ecommerce, Fortune 100, SaaS and Media websites are doing—in real
time. Panopta checks each of these sites every minute, making
requests from our global network of monitoring locations. We're
continually gathering information on uptime, speed and outage
duration.  Data from the last 30 days is combined into our proprietary
index score.

Argus Panoptes (Ἄργος Πανόπτης), guardian of the heifer-nymph Io
and son of Arestor,[1] was a primordial giant whose epithet,
"Panoptes", "all-seeing", led to his being described with multiple,
often one hundred, eyes. The epithet Panoptes was applied to the
Titan of the Sun, Helios, and was taken up as an epithet by Zeus,
Zeus Panoptes. "In a way," Walter Burkert observes, "the power and
order of Argos the city are embodied in Argos the neatherd, lord
of the herd and lord of the land, whose name itself is the name of
the land."
