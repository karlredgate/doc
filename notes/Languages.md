elixir lang
-----------

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building
scalable and maintainable applications.

Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency,
distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully
used in web development and the embedded software domain.

Fantom is a general purpose object-oriented programming language
that runs on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), JavaScript, and
the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR).  Its primary design goal
is to provide a standard library API that abstracts away the question
of whether the code will ultimately run on the JRE or CLR. Like C#
and Java, Fantom uses a curly brace syntax. The language supports
functional programming through closures and concurrency through the
Actor model. Fantom takes a "middle of the road" approach to its
type system, blending together aspects of both static and dynamic
typing.

Boo is an object-oriented, statically typed, general-purpose programming language that seeks to make use of the Common Language Infrastructure's support for Unicode, internationalization, and web applications, while using a Python-inspired syntax[2] and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility. Some features of note include type inference, generators, multimethods, optional duck typing, macros, true closures, currying, and first-class functions.

Boo is free software released under the BSD 3-Clause license. It is compatible with both the Microsoft .NET and Mono frameworks.

Ceylon is an object-oriented, strongly statically typed programming language with an emphasis on immutability, created by Red Hat. Ceylon programs run on the Java Virtual Machine, and can be compiled to JavaScript.[5][6] The language design focuses on readability, predictability, toolability, modularity, and metaprogrammability.

Gosu is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine released under the Apache 2.[1] This general-purpose programming language is used in several open-source software projects including SparkGS and Ragnar DB among several others, and is widely used in the insurance industry via Guidewire Software's commercial products.

Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia (the name comes from the Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg).[3] Kotlin was named Language of the Month in the January 2012 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal.[4] While not syntax compatible with Java, Kotlin is designed to interoperate with Java code and is reliant on Java code from the existing Java Class Library, such as the collections framework.

Haxe is an open source, high-level, cross-platform, multi-paradigm programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code for many different platforms from a single code-base.

Code written in the Haxe language can be source-to-source compiled into ActionScript 3, JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, Python, PHP, Lua[7] and Node.js.[2][5][8][9] Haxe can also produce SWF and Neko bytecode.

Major users of Haxe include TiVo, Prezi, Nickelodeon, Disney, Mattel, Hasbro, Coca Cola, Toyota and BBC.[10][11] OpenFL and Flambe are popular Haxe frameworks that enable the creation of multi-platform content from a single codebase.

Opa is an open source programming language for developing scalable web applications.

It can be used for both client-side and server-side scripting, where complete programs are written in Opa and subsequently compiled to Nodejs on the server and JavaScript on the client, with the compiler automating all communication between the two.[2][3] Opa implements strong, static typing, which can be helpful in protecting against security issues such as SQL injections and cross-site scripting attacks.[4]

The language was first officially presented at the OWASP conference in 2010,[5] and the source code was released on GitHub[6] in June 2011, under a GNU Affero General Public License. Later, the license changed to the MIT license for the framework part (library) and AGPL for the compiler so that applications written in Opa can be released under any license, proprietary or open source.

TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.[2][3][4][5] TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for client-side or server-side (Node.js) execution.

CoffeeScript is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell in an effort to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability.[3] Specific additional features include list comprehension and pattern matching.

CoffeeScript support is included in Ruby on Rails version 3.1.[4] In 2011, Brendan Eich referenced CoffeeScript as an influence on his thoughts about the future of JavaScript.

Dart is a general-purpose programming language originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-408).[4] It is used to build web, server and mobile applications, and for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.[5] It is open-source software under a BSD license.

Dart is a class-based, single inheritance, object-oriented language with C-style syntax which can optionally transcompile into JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, and optional typing.

Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS) is a programming language feature in D that allows any function to be called using the syntax for method calls (as in Object-oriented programming), by using the receiver as the first parameter, and the given arguments as the remaining parameters.[1] UFCS is particularly useful when function calls are chained.,[2] behaving similar to pipes, or various dedicated operators available in functional languages for passing values through an expression. It allows free-functions to fills a role similar to extension methods in some other languages. Another benefit of the method call syntax is use with 'dot-autocomplete' in IDEs, which use type information to show a list of available functions, dependant on the context. When the programmer starts with an argument, the set of potentially applicable functions is greatly narrowed down, aiding discoverability.

Julia
-----

Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed to address the requirements of high-performance numerical and scientific computing while also being effective for general-purpose programming,[15][16][17][18] web use[19][20] or as a specification language.[21] Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with parametric types in a fully dynamic programming language and multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. It allows concurrent, parallel and distributed computing, and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. Julia is garbage-collected,[22] uses eager evaluation and includes efficient libraries for floating-point calculations, linear algebra, random number generation, fast Fourier transforms and regular expression matching.
