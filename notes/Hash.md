The CRISP Web cache
-------------------

The CRISP Web Cache is a scalable Internet proxy cache developed in a collaboration with Misha Rabinovich and others at AT&T Research. The CRISP cache is one aspect of a larger project studying Caching and Replication for Internet Service Performance at AT&T.

CRISP caches are structured as a collection of autonomous proxy servers that share their cache contents through a mapping service. The first paper (HOTOS-VI) below describes this in high level and describes our first implementation. The second paper explores several possible implementations of a mapping service, and describes Crispy Squid. The third paper (WISP98) describes Crispy Squid, our most current implementation of the CRISP Web cache architecture.

The initial prototype CRISP cache was built by Syam Gadde. AT&T is currently providing a limited release of the source code; for more information, contact Misha Rabinovich.
