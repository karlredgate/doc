Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege was a German philosopher, logician,
and mathematician. Considered a major figure in mathematics, he is
responsible for the development of modern logic and making contributions
to the foundations of mathematics. He is also understood by many
to be the father of analytic philosophy, where he concentrated on
the philosophy of language and mathematics. Though largely ignored
during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) and Bertrand Russell
(1872–1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians
and philosophers.
