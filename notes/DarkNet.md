Our DNSBL lists any kind of Backscatterer which we see at the
UCEPROTECT-Network.  You can simply use this list via DNS at
ips.backscatterer.org for scoring or rejecting misdirected bounces
and misdirected autoresponders and sender callouts from abusive
systems.  Operators of big mailservers or providers are recommended

A network telescope (also known as a darknet, Internet motion sensor
or black hole) is an Internet system that allows one to observe
different large-scale events taking place on the Internet. The basic
idea is to observe traffic targeting the dark (unused) address-space
of the network. Since all traffic to these addresses is suspicious,
one can gain information about possible network attacks (random
scanning worms, and DDoS backscatter) as well as other misconfigurations
by observing it.
