Cross Platform UI
-----------------

### Cordova

[Apache Cordova]( http://cordova.apache.org/ )
is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you to use
standard web technologies - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform
development. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each
platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each
device''s capabilities such as sensors, data, network status, etc.

### Sencha

[Sencha Touch]( https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/ )
is the leading MVC-based JavaScript framework for building cross-platform
mobile web applications. Sencha Touch leverages hardware acceleration
techniques to provide high-performance UI components for mobile devices.

Test Frameworks
---------------

### Karma

On the AngularJS team, we rely on testing and we always seek
better tools to make our life easier. That is why we created
[Karma]( https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html ) - a
test runner that fits all our needs.

### Jasmine

[Jasmine]( http://jasmine.github.io/ )
is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks.
It does not require a DOM.
And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

### BrowserSync

With each web page, device and browser, testing time grows exponentially.
From live reloads to URL pushing, form replication to click mirroring,
[Browsersync]( https://browsersync.io/ )
cuts out repetitive manual tasks. It is like an extra pair of
hands. Customise an array of sync settings from the UI or command line to
create a personalised test environment. Need more control? Browsersync
is easily integrated with your web platform, build tools, and other
*Node.js* projects.
