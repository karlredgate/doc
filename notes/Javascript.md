### jQuery

### Backbone.js

*Backbone.js* is a JavaScript library with a RESTful JSON interface
and is based on the model–view–presenter (MVP) application design
paradigm. Backbone is known for being lightweight, as its only hard
dependency is on one JavaScript library, *Underscore.js,* plus
jQuery for use of the full library.  It is designed for developing
single-page web applications, and for keeping various parts of
web applications (e.g. multiple clients and the server) synchronized.
Backbone was created by Jeremy Ashkenas, who is also known for
CoffeeScript and Underscore.js.

### Chaplin.js

[Chaplin.js]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplin.js )
is an open-source client-side JavaScript web framework based on the
model–view–controller (MVC) software architectural pattern. *Chaplin.js*
uses the *Backbone.js* library and is intended for developing single-page
applications.

### Knockout.js

[Knockout.js]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_(web_framework) )
is a standalone JavaScript implementation of the Model-View-ViewModel
pattern with templates. The underlying principles are therefore:

 * a clear separation between domain data, view components and
   data to be displayed
 * the presence of a clearly defined layer of specialized code
   to manage the relationships between the view components

The latter leverages the native event management features of the
JavaScript language.

These features streamline and simplify the specification of complex
relationships between view components, which in turn make the display
more responsive and the user experience richer.

Knockout was developed and is maintained as an open source project
by Steve Sanderson, a Microsoft employee. As the author said, "it
continues exactly as-is, and will evolve in whatever direction I
and its user community wishes to take it", and stressed, "this isn’t
a Microsoft product".

### Underscore.js

[Underscore.js]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underscore.js )
is a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for common
programming tasks. It is comparable to features provided by
*Prototype.js* and the Ruby language, but opts for a functional
programming design instead of extending object prototypes. For
example, *Underscore.js*'s `_.each` function delegates to the host
environment's native `forEach` implementation when present, or a
compatible version when absent. The documentation refers to
*Underscore.js* as "the tie to go along with jQuery's tux, and
*Backbone.js*'s suspenders."  *Underscore.js* was created by Jeremy
Ashkenas, who is also known for *Backbone.js* and CoffeeScript.

### Ember.js

[Ember.js]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js )
is an open-source JavaScript web framework, based on the
Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) pattern. It allows developers to create
scalable single-page web applications by incorporating common idioms
and best practices into the framework.

Ember is used on many popular websites, including Discourse, Groupon,
Vine, Live Nation, Nordstrom, and Chipotle. Although primarily
considered a framework for the web, it is also possible to build
desktop and mobile applications in Ember. The most notable example
of an Ember desktop application is Apple Music, a feature of the
iTunes desktop application.

### reactive

Simple and Flexible template and view binding engine with support
for custom bindings and real-time updates on model changes.

Cross Platform UI
-----------------

### Cordova

[Apache Cordova]( http://cordova.apache.org/ )
is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you to use
standard web technologies - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform
development. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each
platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each
device''s capabilities such as sensors, data, network status, etc.

### Sencha

[Sencha Touch]( https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/ )
is the leading MVC-based JavaScript framework for building cross-platform
mobile web applications. Sencha Touch leverages hardware acceleration
techniques to provide high-performance UI components for mobile devices.

### Google Closure

Java program that reads javascript and emits "better" javascript.

Test Frameworks
---------------

### Karma

On the AngularJS team, we rely on testing and we always seek
better tools to make our life easier. That is why we created
[Karma]( https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html ) - a
test runner that fits all our needs.

### Jasmine

[Jasmine]( http://jasmine.github.io/ )
is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks.
It does not require a DOM.
And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

### BrowserSync

With each web page, device and browser, testing time grows exponentially.
From live reloads to URL pushing, form replication to click mirroring,
[Browsersync]( https://browsersync.io/ )
cuts out repetitive manual tasks. It is like an extra pair of
hands. Customise an array of sync settings from the UI or command line to
create a personalised test environment. Need more control? Browsersync
is easily integrated with your web platform, build tools, and other
*Node.js* projects.
