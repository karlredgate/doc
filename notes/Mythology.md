She was famous for both beauty and loquacity (a trait her parents
attempted to curb). She was incapable of keeping secrets, and so
revealed to Jupiter's wife Juno his affair with Juturna (Larunda's
fellow nymph, and the wife of Janus). For betraying his trust,
Jupiter cut out Lara's tongue and ordered Mercury, the psychopomp,
to conduct her to Avernus, the gateway to the Underworld and realm
of Pluto. Mercury, however, fell in love with Lara and had sex with
her on the way; this act has also been interpreted as a rape. Lara
thereby became mother to two children, referred to as the Lares,
invisible household gods. However, she had to stay in a hidden
cottage in the woods so that Jupiter would not find her.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dea_Tacita

In Roman mythology, Dea Tacita ("the silent goddess") was a goddess of the dead. Ovid's Fasti includes a passage describing a rite propitiating Dea Tacita in order to "seal up hostile mouths / and unfriendly tongue" at Feralia on 21 February.

In later times, she was equated with the naiad Larunda. In this guise, Dea Tacita was worshipped at a festival called Larentalia on 23 December.

Goddesses Mutae Tacitae were invoked to destroy a hated person: in an inscription from Cambodunum in Raetia, someone asks "ut mutus sit Quartus" and "erret fugiens ut mus".

These silent goddesses are the personification of terror of obscurity.
