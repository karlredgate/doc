A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure,
conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test
whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are
possible, but false negatives are not, thus a Bloom filter has a
100% recall rate. In other words, a query returns either "possibly
in set" or "definitely not in set".
