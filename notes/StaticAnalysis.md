### Sparse

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse

Sparse is a computer software tool designed to find possible coding
faults in the Linux kernel.[2] Unlike other such tools, this static
analysis tool was initially designed to only flag constructs that were
likely to be of interest to kernel developers, such as the mixing of
pointers to user and kernel address spaces.

Sparse checks for known problems and allows the developer to include
annotations in the code that convey information about data types, such
as the address space that pointers point to and the locks that a function
acquires or releases.
