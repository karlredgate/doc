### Scribble

Scribble is a language to describe application-level protocols among
communicating systems. A protocol represents an agreement on how
participating systems interact with each other. Without a protocol,
it is hard to do meaningful interaction: participants simply cannot
communicate effectively, since they do not know when to expect the
other parties to send data, or whether the other party is ready to
receive data. However, having a description of a protocol has further
benefits. It enables verification to ensure that the protocol can
be implemented without resulting in unintended consequences, such
as deadlocks.
