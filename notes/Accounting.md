Cost of goods sold (COGS) refer to the carrying value of goods sold
during a particular period.

Costs are associated with particular goods using one of several
formulas, including specific identification, first-in first-out
(FIFO), or average cost. Costs include all costs of purchase, costs
of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories
to their present location and condition. Costs of goods made by the
business include material, labor, and allocated overhead. The costs
of those goods not yet sold are deferred as costs of inventory until
the inventory is sold or written down in value.

Carrying value - Book value
----------------------------

In accounting, book value is the value of an asset according to its
balance sheet account balance. For assets, the value is based on
the original cost of the asset less any depreciation, amortization
or impairment costs made against the asset. Traditionally, a company's
book value is its total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities.
However, in practice, depending on the source of the calculation,
book value may variably include goodwill, intangible assets, or
both.  The value inherent in its workforce, part of the Intellectual
capital of a company, is always ignored.  When intangible assets
and goodwill are explicitly excluded, the metric is often specified
to be "tangible book value".
