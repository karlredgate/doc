Fibromyalgia
------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia#Signs_and_symptoms

The defining symptoms of fibromyalgia are chronic widespread pain,
fatigue, sleep disturbance, and heightened pain in response to
tactile pressure (allodynia). Other symptoms may include tingling
of the skin (paresthesias), prolonged muscle spasms, weakness
in the limbs, nerve pain, muscle twitching, palpitations, and
functional bowel disturbances.

Many people experience cognitive dysfunction (known as "fibrofog"),
which may be characterized by impaired concentration, problems with
short and long-term memory, short-term memory consolidation, impaired
speed of performance, inability to multi-task, cognitive overload,
and diminished attention span. Fibromyalgia is often associated
with anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Other symptoms often attributed to fibromyalgia that may be due to
a comorbid disorder include:

 * myofascial pain syndrome, also referred to as chronic myofascial pain
 * diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias,
 * functional bowel disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome,
 * genitourinary symptoms and interstitial cystitis,
 * dermatological disorders,
 * headaches,
 * myoclonic twitches,
 * and symptomatic hypoglycemia.

Although fibromyalgia is classified based on the presence of chronic
widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the
shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas. Many sufferers
also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high
rates of comorbid temporomandibular joint dysfunction. 20â€“30% of
people with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus
may also have fibromyalgia.
