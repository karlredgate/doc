[Linguistic relativity]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity ),
sometimes called the Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis or Whorfianism,
is a hypothesis in linguistics and cognitive science that holds
that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view
or cognition.

Connectionism
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism )
relates between languages and
(MachineLearning.md)/AI.

I have notes in the (Compilers.md) page about LojBan also.
