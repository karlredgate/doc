Epistemic modality deals with a speaker's evaluation/judgment of,
degree of confidence in, or belief of the knowledge upon which a
proposition is based.  In other words, epistemic modality refers
to the way speakers communicate their doubts, certainties, and
guesses—their "modes of knowing".

In other words, epistemic modality concerns an estimation of the
likelihood that (some aspect of) a certain state of affairs is/has
been/will be true (or false) in the context of the possible world
under consideration. This estimation of likelihood is situated on
a scale going from certainty that the state of affairs applies, via
a neutral or agnostic stance towards its occurrence, to certainty
that it does not apply, with intermediary positions on the positive
and the negative sides of the scale.

[Linguistic relativity]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity ),
sometimes called the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis or Whorfianism,
is a hypothesis in linguistics and cognitive science that holds
that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view
or cognition.

Connectionism
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism )
relates between languages and
(MachineLearning.md)/AI.

I have notes in the (Compilers.md) page about LojBan also.
