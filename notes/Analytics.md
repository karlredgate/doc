Web Beacon
----------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon

A web beacon is an object embedded in a web page or email, which
unobtrusively (usually invisibly) allows checking that a user has
accessed the content. Common uses are email tracking and page tagging
for web analytics. Alternative names are web bug, tracking bug,
tag, or page tag.

Common names for web beacons implemented through
an embedded image include tracking pixel, pixel tag, 1Ã—1 gif, and
clear gif. When implemented using JavaScript, they may be called
JavaScript tags.

There is a work in progress to standardize an
interface that web developers can use to asynchronously transfer
small HTTP data from the User Agent to a web server that call it
simply beacons (in the context of web development) which can be
used to send data to a web server prior to the loading of the
document without delaying the load and affecting the perception of
page load performance for the next navigation.

### Ghostery

Ghostery is a proprietary freeware privacy and security-related
browser extension and mobile application for Mozilla Firefox, Google
Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Opera, Apple Safari, iOS,
Android and Firefox Mobile, owned by Ghostery, Inc. (formerly
Evidon). It enables its users to easily detect and control javascript
code (commonly known as "Tags" or "Trackers") that are embedded in
a web page, invisible to the user, allowing collection of the user's
browsing habits via placing of HTTP cookies and other types of
tracking such as canvas fingerprinting.
