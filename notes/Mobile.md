-----------------

Some of these tools I found through Ayesha Khalid - who
mentioned
[MIT hacking medicine]( http://hackingmedicine.mit.edu/toolkits/ ).
The site mentioned mobile toolkits.

Accelerated Mobile Pages Project (AMP)
-------------------------

AMP HTML is a way to build web pages for static content that render
with reliable, fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what
many perceive as painfully slow page load times â€“ especially when
reading content on the mobile web.

AMP HTML is entirely built on existing web technologies. It achieves
reliable performance by restricting some parts of HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. These restrictions are enforced with a validator that
ships with AMP HTML. To make up for those limitations AMP HTML
defines a set of custom elements for rich content beyond basic HTML.

Project Ara
-----------

Project Ara is the codename for an unnamed modular smartphone that
is essentially a computer board with compatible modules. The platform
will include a endoskeletal frame with modules of the owner's choice,
such as a display, camera or an extra battery.

The phone itself can be swapped from malfunctioning modules or
upgrades as innovations emerge, providing longer handset cycle
lifetime, and potentially reducing electronic waste. Project Ara
smartphone is scheduled to release a developer version in the United
States in the fourth quarter of 2016 with a target bill of materials
cost of $50 for a basic grey phone. A consumer version is not
expected until at least 2017.

The project was originally headed by the Advanced Technology and
Projects team within Motorola Mobility while it was a Google
subsidiary. Although Google has since divested Motorola to Lenovo,
it retained the ATAP group, now a division under Android. The project
separated from ATAP and is now an independent division.
