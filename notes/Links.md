Yandex.Tank is a utility for load testing and performance analysis
of web services and applications. Tank was developed at Yandex in
2006 for testing the banner system. Now it is one of the main tools
for measuring performance.

The modular architecture of Yandex.Tank allows using various load
generators. These include the high-performance asynchronous hit-based
HTTP request generator Phantom and the scenario-based utility jMeter,
which generates loads for different types of protocols.

Tregex, Tsurgeon and Semgrex

Tregex is a utility for matching patterns in trees, based on tree
relationships and regular expression matches on nodes (the name is
short for "tree regular expressions"). Tregex comes with Tsurgeon,
a tree transformation language. Also included from version 2.0 on
is a similar package which operates on dependency graphs (class
SemanticGraph, called semgrex.

CoNLL-X Shared Task: Multi-lingual Dependency Parsing

The shared task of CoNLL-X will be multi-lingual dependency parsing.
Following previous CoNLL shared tasks (NP bracketing, chunking,
clause identification, language independent named-entity recognition,
and semantic role labeling), this task aims to define and extend
the current state of the art in dependency parsing - a technology
which complements the previous tasks by producing a different kind
of syntactic description of input text.
