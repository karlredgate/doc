WASTE

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WASTE

WASTE was a peer-to-peer and friend-to-friend protocol and software
application developed by Justin Frankel at Nullsoft in 2003 that
features instant messaging, chat rooms, and file browsing/sharing
capabilities.

Several developers have modified and upgraded the WASTE client and
protocol. The SourceForge edition is considered by many to be the
official development branch, but there are several forks.
