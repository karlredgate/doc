Current appliance using Paragon does not support BitLocker.
This is a problem for two reasons.
The first is that we silently ignore the bitlocker drives and 
they are not backed up.
Also, we do not support 32bit machines - which are old,
and Microsoft recommends BitLocker for new OS installs.
So, old machines are not supported and new machines are not
supported.
