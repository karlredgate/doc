### Sony Network

The group, which calls itself LizardSquad, started attacking the
gaming networks on or around Christmas Day. Various statements
posted by self-described LizardSquad members on their open online
chat forum — chat.lizardpatrol.com — suggest that these misguided
individuals launched the attack for no other reason than because
they thought it would be amusing to annoy and disappoint people who
received new Xbox and Playstation consoles as holiday gifts.

Credential Reuse

credmap: The Credential Mapper

Credmap is an open source tool that was created to bring awareness to the dangers of credential reuse. It is capable of testing supplied user credentials on several known websites to test if the password has been reused on any of these. An official introductionary post can be found here.

Contrast Security
-----------------

https://www.contrastsecurity.com/

Most companies build or buy software apps to run their business.
Unfortunately, application code exposes critical vulnerabilities
to hackers.

Contrast solves this complex problem with a bold new secure technology
platform that transforms application security by making apps
self-protecting. Intelligent Contrast agents are injected into app
code, instrumenting apps with thousands of smart, agile sensors
that detect and correct vulnerabilities before deployment, and
protect apps while operating. No legacy security tool can protect
every app. But a tenacious army of intelligent Contrast sensors
can.

The Contrast technology platform is a fundamentally new way to
protect a company from threats, giving our customers visibility and
accuracy that verges on clairvoyance.

Because Contrast technology works hand-in-glove with agile development
teams, it transforms every app in a company’s portfolio from a weak
spot into a strong point to decisively repel attacks.

We reject the old paradigm of periodic and serial scanning, hacking, and patching, which has proven expensive and ineffective. Instead, Continuous Application Security (CAS) relies on security instrumentation in every application. This instrumentation provides security visibility, assessment, and protection in real time and in parallel across the entire application portfolio. CAS is a unified program covering the entire software lifecycle, including both development and production, designed to create a clear line of sight from the threat to strong defenses, and ultimately to assurance.
