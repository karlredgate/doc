Seneca - Microservice Library
-----------------------------

So you want to write microservices in Node.js? Seneca’s job is to
make your life easier. The funny thing is, Seneca did not start out
as a microservices framework at all. It was a framework for building
Minimum Viable Products. To build an MVP, you need to be able to
plug together pieces of code quickly. You should be able to list a
set of basic functionalities, such as user accounts, database
connectors, content delivery, administration backends, etc, and get
a web application that “just works”. You then extend and enhance
to add your own secret sauce.

### NodeZoo

NodeZoo is a search engine for Node.js modules. The complete system is an example of a real- world service built using Node.js microservices. Each microservice is published in its own GitHub repository. The code base is intended to be used as a larger-scale example and as a starting point for your own projects. See the system at NodeZoo.
