Considering `NW.js` over Electron.
Electron seems more interesting.

An app based on the same code is [LightTable]( http://lighttable.com/ ).
The source for LightTable is on
[github]( https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable ) and there is a
[Wikipedia page]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Table_(software) )
about it also.

Electron app is a menubar app.

is another tool from [maxogden]( https://github.com/maxogden ) that
