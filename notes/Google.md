Fuchsia seems to be using the Flutter widget framework for its user interface with rendering done in Escher, a physically-based renderer supporting sophisticated effects such as volumetric shadows, color bleeding, light diffusion and others. These high graphic capabilities and the targeted hardware platforms with fast processors and lots of RAM suggest the OS may be intended for virtual reality headsets if it proves successful.

To help building applications, Fuchsia uses Mojo, which is a “collection of inter-process communication technologies, protocols and a runtime for creating applications and services that are composable while being loosely coupled.” Mojo has bindings for Dart, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python and Rust, according to Pauli Olavi Ojala.
