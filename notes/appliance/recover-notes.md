I understand that we have current code that does not work this way


If we used the license ID as the key, then when we replace an appliance
the it would not need a rename.

I would expect the API server to have a move-license verb to change the
UUID associated with the appliance.

Create a redirect file for an appliance that points at the correct bucket.
