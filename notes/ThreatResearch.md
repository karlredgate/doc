Cymon is the largest open tracker of malware, phishing, botnets, spam, and more. Brought to you by eSentire.

Cymon is an open source threat intelligence aggregator. It ingests over 180 sources daily to track malware, phishing, botnets, spam and more. Over 20,000 unique IPs are added to the Cymon database every day. To date, Cymon has logged more than six million IP addresses and more than 33.7 million security events. In the SC Labs we use Cymon to backstop virtually all of our other tools.

World's First Open Threat Intelligence Community
Threat sharing in the security industry remains mainly ad-hoc and informal, filled with blind spots, frustration, and pitfalls. Our vision is for companies and government agencies to gather and share relevant, timely, and accurate information about new or ongoing cyberattacks and threats as quickly as possible to avoid major breaches (or minimize the damage from an attack). AlienVaultâ€™s Open Threat Exchange (OTX) delivers the first truly open threat intelligence community that makes this vision a reality.

The AlienVault Open Threat Exchange (OTX) is among our most useful threat intelligence tools. It is an open source of indicators of compromise (IoCs) supported by the community. That community comprises both AlienVault users and those who are not customers of AlienVault. If you own an AlienVault appliance, however, you can both consume and automatically contribute what the company calls "pulses." At this writing there are 24,000-plus users who have contributed over 792,000 indicators in more than 6,000 pulses. Each pulse contains a collection of IoCs targeted at a particular focus. For example, during the recent frenzy over Grizzly Steppe there were six pulses contributed over the course of four days.

We have taken a stand in the past relative to STIX and TAXII. We believe that these are at the top of the list when it comes to cyber intelligence interoperability. Sadly, there are not yet a lot of devices that accept STIX files. There are more today than there were yesterday, though, and there will be more tomorrow. So the trend is in the right direction. What is needed, among other things, to push this along, though, is a growing collection of devices that can both consume and create STIX files. This month's First Look is exactly that. And it is exactly that on steroids.
