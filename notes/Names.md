Draugr
------

Draugar possess superhuman strength, can increase their size at
will, and carry the unmistakable stench of decay. "The appearance
of a draugr was that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally
hideous to look at." They are undead figures from Norse and Icelandic
mythology that appear to retain some semblance of intelligence.
They exist either to guard their treasure, wreak havoc on living
beings, or torment those who had wronged them in life. The draugr's
ability to increase its size also increased its weight, and the
body of the draugr was described as being extremely heavy. Thorolf
of Eyrbyggja saga was "uncorrupted, and with an ugly look about
him... swollen to the size of an ox," and his body was so heavy
that it could not be raised without levers. They are also
noted for the ability to rise from the grave as wisps of smoke and
"swim" through solid rock, which would be useful as a means of
exiting their graves.
