Best description of AD on
[serverfault]( http://serverfault.com/questions/402580/what-is-active-directory-domain-services-and-how-does-it-work ).

Services
--------

Active Directory is made up of several services:

 * Domain Services
 * Certificate Services
 * Federated Services
 * Lightweight Directory Services
 * Rights Management Services

be integrated with the rest of AD.
