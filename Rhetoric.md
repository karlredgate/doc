"You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk
about at parties, you want me on that wall -- you need me on that wall."

*- delivered by Jack Nicholson (from the movie A Few Good Men)*

"And while there will be time enough to debate our continuing differences,
now is the time to recognize that that which unites us is greater than
that which divides us."

*- Al Gore, 2000 Concession Speech*

"We remember today that all our gentle heroes of Vietnam have given us
a lesson in something more: a lesson in living love -- their love for
their families lives; their love for their buddies on the battlefields
and friends back home lives; their love of their country lives."

*- Ronald Reagan, Address at the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial*

"Much of what I say might sound bitter, but it's the truth. Much of what
I say might sound like it's stirring up trouble, but it's the truth. Much
of what I say might sound like it is hate, but it's the truth."

*- Malcolm X*
